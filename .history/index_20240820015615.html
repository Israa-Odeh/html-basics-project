                    <summary>When did tacos first appear in the united states?</summary>
                    <p>Tacos first appeared in the
                        United States in the early 1900s. They gained significant popularity in the 1960s and 1970s,
                        particularly with the rise of fast-food chains like Taco Bell, which introduced them to a
                        broader
                        audience.</p>
